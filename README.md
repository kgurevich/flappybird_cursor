# Cyber Dragon - Nightcore Edition üê≤‚ö°

A cyberpunk-themed dragon flight game built with maximum efficiency and minimal effort by a lazy but brilliant engineer. Experience the neon-soaked world where a metalcore cyber dragon navigates through pulsing energy barriers.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Nightcore Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Neon colors, pulsing animations, and grid-based backgrounds
- **Metalcore Cyber Dragon**: A badass dragon with glowing spikes and boost trails
- **Hold-to-Boost Controls**: Hold SPACE for continuous thrust - much more civilized than button mashing
- **BREATH ATTACK**: Press X to unleash devastating fire breath that destroys barriers (2-second cooldown)
- **Particle Effects**: Boost trails, explosion effects, score celebrations, and fiery breath particles
- **Animated Neon Barriers**: Pulsing energy barriers with dynamic glow effects
- **Single File Architecture**: Everything in one HTML file - no build process, no dependencies
- **Responsive Controls**: Space bar, mouse, or touch - works everywhere

## How to Play üéÆ

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. **HOLD SPACE** to boost the cyber dragon upward
3. **RELEASE SPACE** to let gravity take over
4. **PRESS X** to unleash a devastating breath attack that destroys barriers in front of you
5. Navigate through the pulsing neon barriers (or destroy them!)
6. Try to beat your high score in this cyberpunk wasteland
7. Press **R** to restart when the system inevitably fails

## Lazy Engineering Principles Applied üß†

1. **Single File**: Why manage multiple files when one does the trick?
2. **No Dependencies**: Zero npm packages, zero build tools, zero headaches
3. **CSS Animations**: Let the browser do the heavy lifting for visual effects
4. **Simple Particle System**: Efficient rectangle-based particles for maximum cyberpunk vibes
5. **Hold Controls**: More intuitive than rapid-fire clicking
6. **Efficient Rendering**: Canvas API with dynamic gradients and glow effects
7. **Lazy Loading**: Barriers generated only when needed
8. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of particles and off-screen objects

## Technical Details üîß

- **Canvas Size**: 400x600px (perfect for any screen)
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS via `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Physics**: Continuous boost system with velocity limits
- **Visual Effects**: Dynamic HSL color cycling, particle systems, glow effects
- **Collision Detection**: Simple rectangle-based AABB collision
- **Barrier Generation**: Every 150 frames (2.5 seconds at 60 FPS)
- **Dragon Physics**: 0.4 gravity, -0.8 continuous boost power, 8 max velocity

## Cyberpunk Features üåÉ

- **Animated Background**: Color-shifting gradient with cyberpunk hues
- **Neon Grid**: Subtle grid overlay for that authentic cyber aesthetic
- **Pulsing Barriers**: Energy barriers with dynamic glow and color cycling
- **Particle Systems**: Boost trails, explosions, and score effects
- **Glowing Typography**: Orbitron font with neon text shadows
- **Border Animation**: Pulsing canvas border that shifts between cyan and magenta
- **Dynamic Dragon**: Changes color and glow based on boost state

## Browser Compatibility üåê

Works in any browser that supports:
- HTML5 Canvas
- ES6 JavaScript
- CSS3 Animations and Gradients
- Google Fonts (Orbitron)

So basically... everything made after 2015.

## File Structure üìÅ

```
Cyber Dragon/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html    # The entire cyberpunk experience (HTML + CSS + JS)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # This file
```

That's it. Two files. Maximum laziness achieved.

## Running the Game üöÄ

```bash
# Option 1: Double-click index.html
# Option 2: Open with any web browser
# Option 3: Use a simple HTTP server (if you're feeling fancy)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Control Scheme üéÆ

- **HOLD SPACE**: Continuous boost (much better than button mashing)
- **RELEASE SPACE**: Let gravity take over
- **X**: Breath attack - destroys barriers in front of you (2-second cooldown)
- **R**: Restart/Reboot system
- **Mouse/Touch**: Hold down for mobile boost support

## Why This Approach? ü§î

As a lazy but brilliant engineer, I optimized for:
- **Zero Setup Time**: No installation, no configuration
- **Maximum Cyberpunk**: Neon everything with minimal code
- **Intuitive Controls**: Hold to boost feels natural
- **Visual Impact**: Maximum aesthetic with simple shapes and effects
- **Instant Gratification**: Open and enter the cyberpunk world immediately
- **Easy Sharing**: Just send the HTML file

## Cyberpunk Lore üìñ

In the neon-soaked digital wasteland of 2087, cyber dragons navigate through energy barriers in the virtual realm. These metalcore beasts are the last remnants of organic life, enhanced with cybernetic implants and powered by pure digital energy. Your mission: guide this cyber dragon through the pulsing barriers of the corporate firewall.

## Future Enhancements (Maybe) üîÆ

If I ever feel less lazy:
- [ ] Synthwave soundtrack (but the silence is atmospheric)
- [ ] More particle effects (but performance is king)
- [ ] Power-ups and abilities (but simplicity is elegant)
- [ ] Leaderboard system (but starting fresh builds character)
- [ ] Multiple dragon types (but one perfect dragon is enough)
- [ ] Procedural barrier patterns (but random is already perfect)

## Performance Notes ‚ö°

- Efficient particle system with automatic cleanup
- Dynamic color generation using HSL for smooth transitions
- Optimized collision detection
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Canvas-based rendering for 60 FPS performance

## License üìÑ

Do whatever you want with this code. I'm too lazy to care about licensing. Spread the cyberpunk love.
